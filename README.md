# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Evil Wordle

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
This project will be like absurdle. It will take guesses from the user and keep changing the answer based on the word the user inputs.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The game will have a large list of five letter words and when the user inputs their first guess, the game will find a list of letters that do not contain those letters or have them out of order if there is not a word without them. The player will have to keep guessing until they back the game into a corner with a single word. We will be using python to create this. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

 TODO,if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am working with Anusha Ghimirey.  Her email and TA: tur82428@temple.edu Xinwen Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At least a better wordle program that gives infinite attempts.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A version of wordle that somewhat  emulates absurdle

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a program that is like absurdle and has. a player enter as many guesses as possible to get the answer.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will have to figure out how to use and download the Rich library for python to add colors and visuals for the game. Both of us will have to learn to convert a text file into a list for just the basic wordle game. For absurdle we will have to figure out how to get the basic infinite wordle to take the user input and read individual characters. Once it can read the indiviual letters then it will have to find words from the list that do not contain those letters and if they do then the program has to find words with letters out of order. The program needs to be able to do that for every entry. We will begin by just creating the wordle game first then implimenting the absurdle part. One thing that is super important is finding a source for a list of five words and making sure it is long enough so the user does not have to guess again multiple times.
